    <div>
        <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our sun and the largest planet in the solar system. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water. The atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, and its iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p> 

        <p>Jupiter is surrounded by more than 50 moons (with more a dozen more awaiting confirmation). Scientists are most interested in the Galilean satellites â€” the four largest moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Europa, Callisto, Ganymede and Io. Jupiter also has three rings, but they are very hard to see and not nearly as intricate as Saturn's. </p>

        <p>Jupiter is named for the king of ancient Roman gods.</p>

            <dt>The Biggest Planet</dt>
                <dd>With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.</dd>
            <dt>Fifth In Line</dt>
                <dd>Mars orbits our sun, a star. Mars is the fourth planet from the sun at a distance of about 228 million km (142 million miles) or 1.52 AU.</dd>
            <dt>Short Day / Long Year</dt>
                <dd>One day on Jupiter takes about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin once). Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).</dd>
            <dt>What's Inside?</dt>
                <dd>Jupiter is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid surface. Jupiter may have a solid, inner core about the size of Earth.</dd>
            <dt>Atmosphere</dt>
                <dd>Jupiter's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He).</dd>
            <dt>Many Moons</dt>
                <dd>Jupiter has 53 known moons, with an additional 16 moons awaiting confirmation of their discovery -- that is a total of 69 moons.</dd>
            <dt>Ringed World</dt>
                <dd>Jupiter has a faint ring system that was discovered in 1979 by the Voyager 1 mission. All four giant planets in our solar system have ring systems.</dd>
            <dt>Exploring Jupiter</dt>
                <dd>Many missions have visited Jupiter and its system of moons. The Juno spacecraft is currently orbiting Jupiter.</dd>
            <dt>Ingredients for Life?</dt>
                <dd>Jupiter cannot support life as we know it. However, some of Jupiter's moons have oceans underneath their crusts that might support life.</dd>
            <dt>Did You Know?</dt>
                <dd>Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm (about the size of Earth) that has been raging for hundreds of years.</dd>
