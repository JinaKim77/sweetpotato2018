    <div>
        <p>The seventh planet from the sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side, orbiting the sun like a rolling ball. </p>

        <p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. </p>

        <p>William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.</p>

            <dt>Size</dt>
                <dd>If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel and Uranus would be about as big as a baseball.</dd>
            <dt>Seventh Planet</dt>
                <dd>Uranus orbits our sun, a star. Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun at a distance of about 2.9 billion km (1.8 billion miles) or 19.19 AU.</dd>
            <dt>Day And Year</dt>
                <dd>One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours (the time it takes for Uranus to rotate or spin once. Uranus makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Uranian time) in about 84 Earth years (30,687 Earth days).</dd>
            <dt>Ice  Giant</dt>
                <dd>Uranus is an ice giant. Most (80 percent or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water (H2O), methane (CH4). and ammonia (NH3) – above a small rocky core.</dd>
            <dt>Atmosphere</dt>
                <dd>Uranus has an atmosphere which is mostly made up of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He), with a small amount of methane (CH4).</dd>
            <dt>Moons</dt>
                <dd>Uranus has 27 moons. Uranus' moons are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</dd>
            <dt>Ringless no more</dt>
                <dd>Uranus has 13 known rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark and the outer rings are brightly colored.</dd>
            <dt>Missions</dt>
                <dd>Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus.</dd>
            <dt>Life</dt>
                <dd>Uranus cannot support life as we know it.</dd>
            <dt>Fun Fact</dt>
                <dd>Like Venus, Uranus has a retrograde rotation (east to west). Unlike any of the other planets, Uranus rotates on its side, which means it spins horizontally.</dd>
