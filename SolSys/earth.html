        <p>Earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets. Our home planet is the only planet in our solar system known to harbor living things. </p>

        <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is an English/German word, which simply means the ground.</p>

            <dt>Size and Distance</dt>
                <dd>With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets, and the fifth largest planet overall. From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the sun. It takes about eight minutes for light from the sun to reach our planet.</dd>
            <dt>Orbit and Rotation</dt>
                <dd>As Earth orbits the sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.</dd>
            <dt> A Day Longer Than a Year</dt>
                <dd>One day on Venus (the time it takes for Venus to rotate or spin once with respect to the stars) lasts as long as 243 Earth days. One day-night cycle on Venus takes 117 Earth days because Venus rotates in the direction opposite of its orbital revolution around the Sun. Venus makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Venusian time) in 225 Earth days or slightly less than 2 Venusian day-night cycles.</dd>
            <dt>Formation</dt>
                <dd>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</dd>
            <dt>Structure</dt>
                <dd>Venus' thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2), with clouds of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) droplets.</dd>
            <dt>Surface</dt>
                <dd>Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains and valleys. Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate.</dd>
            <dt>Atmosphere</dt>
                <dd>Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide and neon. The atmosphere affects Earth's long-term climate and short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful radiation coming from the sun. It also protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the night sky, before they can strike the surface as meteorites.</dd>
            <dt>Potential for Life</dt>
                <dd>Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life possible here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.</dd>
            <dt>Rings</dt>
                <dd>Earth has no rings.</dd>
            <dt>Magnetosphere</dt>
                <dd>Our planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop shape in space.</dd>
