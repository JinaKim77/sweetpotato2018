		<h3>About</h3>
		<p id="secondary">Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ, located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was created by a French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by a Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, a French engineer Albert Caquot and a Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida. It was constructed between 1922 and 1931. The statue is 30m tall (excluding its 8m pedestal) with an arm span of 28m. Christ the Redeemer stands at the peak of the 700m Corcovado mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro.</p>
		
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p id="secondary">The idea of placing a Christian monument on Mt. Corcovado was first suggested by a Vincentian priest, Pedro Maria Boss, in the mid 1850s. The idea however died due to lack of support and later was dismissed because the country became a republic and church was separated from state.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">The Catholic Circle of Rio made a second proposal for a statue in 1920. An event called Semana do Monumento ("Monument Week") was held to raise donations and collect signatures to support the idea. The statue of Jesus with open arms, symbolising peace, was chosen.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">The statue was designed by a local engineer, Heitor da Silva Costa and created by a French sculptor, Paul Landowski. In 1922, Landowski commissioned a fellow Romanian sculptor, Gheorghe Leonida, who created Christ's face. The building materials chosen for the statue were reinforced concrete and soapstone for the outer layers. The construction took 9 years and cost the equivalent of $250,000 for the time.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">Christ the Redeemer statue was struck by lightning twice, in 2008 and later in 2014. On both occasions the fingers suffered most but restorations were quickly initiated.</p>
