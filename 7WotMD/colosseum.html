		<h3>About</h3>
		<p id="secondary">The Colosseum (also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre) is an oval amphitheatre in Rome, Italy. It was built from travertine, tuff and concrete by the emperors of the Flavian dynasty. It is the largest Amphitheatre ever built. The Construction of the Colosseum began in 72 AD and was completed in 80 AD. The Colosseum could hold, on estimate, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators. It was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as animal hunts, executions or dramas. The name "Colosseum" is believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby.</p>
		
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p id="secondary">The Colosseum was built on a filled-in artificial lake made by Nero. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby. Emperor Vespasian's decision to build the Flavian Amphitheatre on the land Nero claimed for himself, was seen as a populist gesture of returning the land to people. It was also constructed in the city centre, placing it symbolically at the heart of Rome.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">The construction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian in 70-72 AD, later continued by his son, Titus in 80 AD. Some more modifications have later been made by Vespasian's younger son, Emperor Domitian, who added the hypogeum (underground tunnels to house animals and slaves) and a gallery to increase the seating capacity.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">In 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire, which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the Amphitheatre. It was not fully repaired until 240.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">During the medieval period, the Colosseum underwent radical changes of use. By late 6th century, a chapel was built into the structure and the arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades were converted into housing and workshops. Around the year 1200, the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum, fortified it and apparently used it as a castle.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">The Colosseum today is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions. Due to pollution and deterioration over time, major restorations were carried out between 1993 and 2000, costing around â‚¬20.6 million at the time.</p>
