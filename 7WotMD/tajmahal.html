		<h3>About</h3>
		<p id="secondary">Taj Mahal, meaning Crown of the Palace, is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in Agra, India. It was comissioned in 1632 by the Muhal emperor, Shah Jahan, to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Construction of Taj Mahal was essentialy completed in 1643, however further work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The complete cost of the Taj Mahal complex was estimated to be around $827 million in 2015 and employed approximately 20,000 artisans. Taj Mahal was designated as a <a href="https://en.unesco.org/" target="_blank">UNESCO</a> World Heritage Site in 1983.</p>
		
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p id="secondary">Taj Mahal was comissioned by Shah Jahan to be built in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, a Persian princess who died giving birth to their 14th child.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">Although earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. The tomb is the central complex of the Taj Mahal. It is surmounted by a large marble dome, commonly called the onion dome due to its shape. The mausoleum's exterior and interior are heavily decorated with carvings and paintings.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">In 1942, Taj Mahal has been disguised by a large scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force. The same happened in the years 1965 and 1971. More recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the Yamuna River, including acid rain. The pollution has been turning Taj Mahal yellow, therefore the Indian government has set up the Taj Trapezium Zone, a 10,400-square-kilometer area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.</p>
