		<h3>About</h3>
		<p id="secondary">Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel. It is located in the Cuzco Region in Peru, 2,430 meters above sea level. It was built using polished dry-stone walls, which were typical of Inca style. The citadel has three primary structures: the Intihuatana (a ritual stone), the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows. By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu has been restored. In 1981, Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary, as well as a <a href="https://en.unesco.org/" target="_blank">UNESCO</a> World Heritage Site in 1983. Since 2007, it is one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.</p>
		
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p id="secondary">Machu Picchu was built around 1450 during the ruling period of 2 Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui and Tupac Inca Yupanqui. It is belived that the citadel was ordered to be built by Pachacutec for himself after a successful military campaign.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">It is estimated that Machu Picchu was occupied by about 750 people at one time, with that number dropping to roughly 100 people during the harsher seasons who focused mainly on maintenance.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">A lot of farming in Machu Picchu was done on the numerous man-made terraces there. Study of the soil showed that the main crops grown were corn and potatoes. However this was not enough to support the ~750 people living at the citadel, hence much of what they ate was imported from the surrounding valleys.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">Machu Picchu was abandoned around 1570 due to Spanish Conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.</p>
