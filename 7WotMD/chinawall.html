		<h3>About</h3>
		<p id="secondary">The Great Wall of China is a series of smaller walls and fortifications made of stone, brick, earth and wood, all merged together after centuries to become what we know as the Great Wall. It was built to protect the Chinese states and empires against raids and invasions from the Eurasian Steppe. Apart from defense, the wall was used for border controls, imposition of duties on goods, regulation of trade and the control of migration. The Great Wall stretches from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west and spans over 21 thousand km.</p>
		
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p id="secondary">In 221 BC, King Zheng of the Qin state conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the first emperor of the Qin dynasty. He ordered the destruction of sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states, however he also ordered the building of new walls along the northern frontier. It's estimated that possibly even up to a million workers died during those works.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">Many dynastied later, some of which acknowledged the Wall and worked on it, the concept of the Great Wall was revived again under the Ming in the 14th century. The Ming have fortified the wall with stone and bricks, as opposed to rammed earth and wood. Up to 25,000 watchtowers are estimated to have been constructed on the wall.</p></br>
		<p id="secondary">Accounts of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe in the early 16th century, however no European would see it for another century. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, and mentions the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de GÃ³is entering the northwestern pass from India.</p>
